      \textbf{Calculus} is about the very large, the very small, and how things
      change. The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract
      ends up explaining the real world.

      \textbf{On the cover} we see a time lapse photograph of the star
      \textit{Polaris}, commonly known as the ``North Star.''  If one
      imagines a line drawn from the South Pole to the North Pole that
      extends infinitely into space, the star \textit{Polaris} appears very
      nearly on this line. Hence as the Earth rotates, we the
      inhabitants of Earth, see the stars rotate around
      \textit{Polaris}. The circular star-trails in this photograph
      are formed by the accumulated light, over a period of time, collected
      the camera's light-sensor. This process of accumulating light
      can be described precisely using the language of calculus as an
      ``integral,'' something that will be introduced in this book.

      \textbf{The graph} shown at the bottom shows us the plot of
      \[
      y=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}
      \]
      along with the plots of the $4$th, $10$th, $14$th, $20$th,
      $24$th, and $34$th degree approximating Maclaurin
      polynomials. As we will see, a sequence of polynomials can often
      approximate a function to an arbitrary precision. Taking the
      limit, we find an ``infinite'' polynomial, called a \textit{power
      series}. Power series are a \textit{key} that allow us to
      \textit{unlock} the mysteries of functions that up and to this
      point have been inaccessible in our studies.
