Taylor Series

Mean value theorem. (Connection)

Says that we can infact do this....

Fxn  = poly at point
Fxn' has same derivative.

build it up by saying fxn


The more terms the better approx we get, we see a similar result with
euler's method and riemann sums.

The approx is exact, as long as the sum converges.


## When do taylor series make sense?

How do we known when the infinite series makes sense?

We can use radius of conv

(in the complex plane?)


## Make more taylor series

We have to be able to take derivartives....

Use taylor series to produce taylor series


Common functions.
e^x, sin(x), cos(x), 1/(1-x)

add taylor series (sum of taylor series is taylor series of sum)

mult taylor series

compose taylor series. (BIG ONE)

Integrating
Diff

Thm (radius of conv is not changed by int/diff)

Euler's formula.
