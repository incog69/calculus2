In the Ratio Test section, we learned that it is powerful to recognize that a series is ``approximately'' geometric, because we know how to decide the convergence and divergence of geometric series.  If $\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} = r$, then the ``tail'' of the series looks like a geometric series of ratio $r$, and follows the same convergence and divergence behavior.

The Root Test uses the same idea in a slightly different situation

\begin{theorem}[The Root Test]
	If $\sum a_k$ is an infinite series of positive terms, and $\lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} = r$, then 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $0 \leq r < 1$, then the series converges.
		\item If $r>1$, then the series diverges.
		\item If $r = 1$, then we learn nothing:  the series could diverge or converge.
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

Notice that the conclusion of the Root Test follows exactly the same form as the Ratio Test.  It does so for exactly the same reason:

If $\sqrt[k]{a_k} \approx r$ for large $k$, then $a_k \approx r^k$ for large $k$, which exactly says that the tail of $a_k$ looks like a geometric series with ratio $r$.

Again, we do not give a formal proof in this course (but if you are interested you can find a proof online!)

\begin{question}
	Consider 
	
	\[
	 \sum_4^\infty \frac{k^5}{k^k}
	\]
	

	 $\lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} = \answer{0}$	
	 
	 So the root test says that the series is
	 
	 \begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice[correct]{The root test says it is convergent}
		\choice{The root test says it is divergent}
		\choice{The root test gives no information in this case, but we know it is convergent through some other method}
		\choice{The root test gives no information in this case, but we know it is divergent through some other method}
	\end{multipleChoice}	
	
	\begin{hint}
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} &= \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\frac{k^5}{k^k}}\\
				&=\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{(k^{\frac{1}{k}})^5}{k}\\
				&=0 \textrm{ since $\lim_{k \to \infty} k^\frac{1}{k} = 1$}
	\end{align*}
	
	So the series is convergent by the root test.
	\end{hint}
\end{question}

Generally the Root test is most useful when you have a lot of powers, and no factorials.  Anytime you see a factorial is a pretty good sign to try the Ratio test.
