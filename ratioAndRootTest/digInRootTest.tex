\maketitle

We learned that the ratio test is a powerful technique based on the
concept of recognizing when a series is ``approximately'' geometric.
If
\[
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} = r,
\]
then the ``tail'' of the series looks like a geometric series of ratio
$r$, and follows the same convergence and divergence behavior as a
geometric series.  The \textit{root test} uses a similar idea in a
slightly different situation.
\begin{theorem}[The Root Test]\index{root test}
  If $\sum^\infty a_k$ is an infinite series of positive terms, and $\lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} = r$, then 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $0 \leq r < 1$, then the series converges.
  \item If $r>1$, then the series diverges.
  \item If $r = 1$, then we learn nothing:  the series could diverge or converge.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
Notice that the conclusion of the root test follows exactly the same
form as the ratio test.  It does so for exactly the same reason:
\begin{quote}
  If $\sqrt[k]{a_k} \approx r$ for large $k$, then $a_k \approx r^k$
  for large $k$, which exactly says that the tail of $a_k$ looks like
  a geometric series with ratio $r$.
\end{quote}
Again, we do not give a formal proof in this course (but if you are
interested you can find a proof online!)

\begin{example}
  Consider 
  \[
  \sum_{k=4}^\infty \frac{k^5}{k^k}
  \]
  Discuss the convergence of this series.
  \begin{explanation}
    We will attempt to use the root test. Setting
    $a_k=\frac{k^5}{k^k}$, write with me
    \[
    \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} = \answer[given]{0}	
    \]
    so the root test
	  \wordChoice{
	   \choice[correct]{says the series is convergent}
	   \choice{says the series is divergent}
	   \choice{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is convergent through some other method}
	   \choice{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is divergent through some other method}}.		
	  \begin{hint}
            \begin{align*}
	      \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} &= \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\frac{k^5}{k^k}}\\
	      &=\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{(k^{\frac{1}{k}})^5}{k}\\
	      &=0 \quad\text{since $\lim_{k \to \infty} k^\frac{1}{k} = 1$}
	    \end{align*}
	    So the series is convergent by the root test.
	  \end{hint}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider 
  \[
  \sum_{k=3}^\infty \frac{2^k}{k^2}
  \]
  Discuss the convergence of this series.
  \begin{explanation}
    We will attempt to use the root test. Setting
    $a_k=\frac{2^k}{k^2}$, write with me
    \[
    \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\frac{2^k}{k^2}} = \answer[given]{2}	
    \]
    so the root test
	  \wordChoice{
	   \choice{says the series is convergent}
	   \choice[correct]{says the series is divergent}
	   \choice{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is convergent through some other method}
	   \choice{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is divergent through some other method}}.

            \begin{align*}
	      \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} &= \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\frac{2^k}{k^2}}\\
	      &=\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{2}{(k^{1/k})^2}\\
	      &=2 \quad\text{since $\lim_{k \to \infty} k^\frac{1}{k} = 1$}
	    \end{align*}
	    So the series is divergent by the root test.
	  \end{hint}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider 
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left(\frac{k^2-k}{k^2+k}\right)^k
  \]
  Discuss the convergence of this series.
  \begin{explanation}
    We will attempt to use the root test. Setting
    $a_k=\left(\frac{k^2-k}{k^2+k}\right)^k$, write with me
    \[
    \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\left(\frac{k^2-k}{k^2+k}\right)^k} = \answer[given]{1}	
    \]
    so the root test
	  \wordChoice{
	   \choice{says the series is convergent}
	   \choice{says the series is divergent}
	   \choice{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is convergent through some other method}
	   \choice[correct]{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is divergent through some other method}}.		
	  \begin{hint}
            \begin{align*}
	      \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} &= \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\left(\frac{k^2-k}{k^2+k}\right)^k}\\
	      &=\lim_{k \to \infty}\frac{k^2-k}{k^2+k}\\
	      &=1
	    \end{align*}
	    So the root test gives no information.  However, we know this series diverges by the divergence test.
	  \end{hint}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{example}
  Consider 
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}
  \]
  Discuss the convergence of this series.
  \begin{explanation}
    We will attempt to use the root test. Setting
    $a_k=\frac{1}{k^2}$, write with me
    \[
    \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\frac{1}{k^2}} = \answer[given]{1}	
    \]
    so the root test
	  \wordChoice{
	   \choice{says the series is convergent}
	   \choice{says the series is divergent}
	   \choice[correct]{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is convergent through some other method}
	   \choice{gives no information in this case, but we know the series is divergent through some other method}}.		
	  \begin{hint}
            \begin{align*}
	      \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} &= \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\frac{1}{k^2}}\\
	      &=\lim_{k \to \infty}\left(k^{1/k}\right)^{-2}\\
	      &=1 \quad\text{since $\lim_{k \to \infty} k^\frac{1}{k} = 1$}
	    \end{align*}
	    So the root test gives no information.  However, we know
            this series converges by the $p$-test.
	  \end{hint}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

Generally the root test is most useful when you have a lot of powers,
and no factorials.  Anytime you see a factorial is a pretty good sign
to try the ratio test.
